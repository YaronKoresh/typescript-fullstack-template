# My Example Platform

### Enterprise-Grade Cool Stuff

Our thing is a unified professional workspace designed to bridge the gap between A and B. Unlike standard conversational interfaces, this platform is engineered for precision, structure, and forensic analysis, aggregating the world's most powerful things into a single, deterministic environment.

---

## 1. Platform Overview & Value Proposition

### 1.1. Unified Intelligence Grid

The platform is built upon a proprietary **Cool Stuff**, an aggregation layer that unifies the world's most powerful things into a single, cohesive interface.

* **One Template, Many Projects:** Instead of working hard, work simple.
* **Super Cool:** The project doing something cool, allowing you to start a complex project with a typescript template and refine the files without crying.
* **Use at your own hapiness:** Treat template as a utility. Choose the best template for the job—whether it's my template, this template, or the best TypeScript template—while being on schedule.

### 1.2. Precision-Engineered Workflows

Standard templates often force you to be a templates engineer, presenting a blank text box where the quality of the code starts entirely from the basics. **TypeScript Template** flips this model.

* **Something 1:** Instead of guessing where to start, this template comes equipped with a basic **TypeScript Structure**.
* **Something 2:** (Empty line).
* **Something 3:** (Empty line).

### 1.3. (The Core Feature)

By using our platform, you bypass the limitations often found in standard consumer-facing web interfaces. This ensures that your professional work is powered by the raw, unthrottled capabilities of the underlying things.

## 2. Advanced Technical Capabilities

### 2.1. Example Capability

The platform incorporates a (deterministic?) suite for doing something, providing architectural (insights?) that standard (which type of standard solutions?) cannot reliably (generate? accomplish?). Unlike (...) interfaces that often (...), this (...) uses (...) to (...).

## 3. Installation & Setup

### 3.1. Prerequisites

Before beginning the installation, ensure your environment meets the following technical requirements:

* **Node.js Runtime**: Version **24.0.0** or higher is strictly required for compatibility with core platform features.
* **Package Manager**: Standard `npm` (Node Package Manager) for dependency management and script execution.
* **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows.

### 3.2. Local Installation

To set up a local development or production instance, execute the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YaronKoresh/my-repo.git
cd my-repo
```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
Execute the installation script to fetch all required server, client, and balancer packages:
```bash
npm install
```

*Note: This process automatically configures Husky git hooks for quality assurance enforcement.*

---

### 3.3. Environment Configuration

The platform utilizes a hybrid configuration model. **That Sensitive Data** is **not** managed via environment files for end-users.

* **(That Sensitive Data Type)**: Users manage their own (type of sensitive data...) directly through the platform's secure web interface. (...) are stored locally in the browser’s storage and are never persisted on the platform’s server.

---

### 3.4. Application Startup

The application must be compiled before execution. Use the following sequence to launch the platform:

1. **Build the Application**:
Generate the production-ready client and server bundles:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. **Start the Server**:
Launch the production instance of the Chat Engines server:
```bash
npm run server
```

For active development, you may utilize `npm run fix-deps` and `npm run fix-code` to ensure your local changes adhere to the project's strict architectural and formatting standards before attempting a commit.

## 4. Developer Architecture & Contribution

This section is intended for contributors and system administrators modifying the core platform logic or maintaining a private fork.

### 4.1. Core System Architecture

* **Component 1**: A description.
* **Component 2**: Another description.

### 4.2. Directory Structure

The codebase is partitioned into distinct functional zones to ensure logic isolation and scalability:

* **`src/server`**: Contains the core backend logic, API endpoints, and service provider integrations.
* **`src/client`**: Houses the frontend application, UI components, and client-side state management.
* **`src/balancer`**: Dedicated logic for internal load balancing, proxy configurations, and model routing.
* **`tools`**: Contains maintenance scripts, deployment utilities, and auxiliary developer tools.

### 4.3. Quality Assurance Protocols

Adherence to the following quality assurance workflows is mandatory for all development activities:

* **Automated Remediation (`npm run fix-deps` and `npm run fix-code`)**: This command executes a comprehensive repair sequence, including internal dependency resolution via `fix-deps`, TypeScript definition regeneration, and strict Prettier/ESLint auto-formatting.
* **Strict Verification (`npm run check`)**: This protocol simulates the CI pipeline locally. It performs a read-only analysis of type safety, code quality, and unit test coverage to ensure the codebase remains in a deployable state.
* **Pre-Commit Enforcement**: The repository utilizes Husky to trigger `lint-staged` verification. Any commit that violates formatting, typing, or testing standards is automatically rejected.

### 4.4. Documentation References

For detailed technical specifications, refer to the internal documentation suite:

* **[Internal API Reference](./docs/internal-api-example.md)**: Comprehensive documentation for server-side endpoints and data schemas.
